# Simple Todo Web App using React

This is a simple Todo web application built with React. The application allows users to manage their tasks with the following features:

## Features

1. **Todo List**: The main page of the application displays a list of all existing todos with their titles and statuses.

2. **Add Todo**: Users can add a new task by typing the task description in the input field and clicking the "Submit" button. The entered task will then be displayed in the UI.

3. **Update Todo Status**: Users can click on a todo to update its status. A todo can be changed from "Pending" to "Completed" and vice versa.

4. **Remove Todo**: Each todo card in the footer has a "Remove" button. Clicking this button will remove the todo from the list.

5. **Todo Count**: Before the title, the number of todos is displayed in the badge to give users an overview of the number of tasks.

## Design

The application has a clean and visually appealing design to provide a seamless user experience. The todo cards are organized neatly with intuitive buttons for actions like updating and removing todos.
