# Project 2: Movie Search Web App

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a movie search application that allows users to search for movies using an input box. Upon receiving the user's input, the application should fetch movie data from the OMDB API and display the relevant movie details.

## Requirements

- The application should have a simple and user-friendly interface built using HTML and CSS.
- JavaScript should be used to handle user interactions and fetch data from the OMDB API.
- Display the fetched movie details, including the movie title and poster image, on the application interface.
- Gracefully handle edge cases, such as when a movie is not found or when the user provides invalid input.

## Instructions

1. Register on the OMDB API website to obtain your API key. The API key will be required to make requests to the OMDB API.

2. Set up a new HTML file and name it "index.html."

3. Create a CSS file named "style.css" to style the application.

4. Create a JavaScript file named "script.js" to implement the functionality.

5. Use the fetch API in JavaScript to request movie data from the OMDB API using the user's input as the search query.

6. Display the fetched movie details in a structured and visually appealing manner on the HTML page.

7. Handle edge cases gracefully, such as displaying a message when a movie is not found or when the user provides invalid input.

## OMDB API

In this project, you will need to use the OMDB API to fetch movie data. You should refer to the OMDB API documentation for details on how to use the API effectively.

1. Obtain your API key from the OMDB API website.

2. Create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as mentioned in the instructions.

3. Implement the application logic in the JavaScript file, including handling user input, making API requests, and displaying movie details.

4. Style the application using CSS to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.

5. Test the application by entering movie titles and checking if the movie details are displayed correctly.

6. Ensure that the application gracefully handles errors and edge cases.
